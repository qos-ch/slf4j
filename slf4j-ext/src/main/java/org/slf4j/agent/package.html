<p>"-javaagent" routines for SLF4J.</p>
<p>The "-javaagent" flag provided in Java 5+ allows for writing
agents in Java, which previously was possible in native code only. The
full details are available at <a
	href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html">http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html</a>.


Please notice that code made available to the java agent is also
available to the actual program executed.</p>
<p>The slf4j-ext-X.Y.Z.jar file provides such a java agent, which is
implemented in AgentPremain.java.  It is used by adding a -javaagent flag to the Java command line:

E.g.
<pre><code>java HelloWorld</code></pre>
is changed to
<pre><code>java -javaagent:/path/to/slf4j-ext-X.Y.Z.jar=<em>OPTIONS</em> HelloWorld</code></pre>

What is actually done, depends on the <em>OPTIONS</em> passed to the agent.  These are listed in AgentOptions.java.
