/**
 * 
 * This demo illustrates usage of SLF4J profilers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * We have been given the task of generating a large number, say N, of random
 * integers. We need to transform that array into a smaller array containing
 * only prime numbers. The new array has to be sorted.
 * 
 * <p>
 * While tackling this problem, we would like to measure the time spent in each
 * subtask.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A typical output for this demo would be:
 * 
 * <pre>
   + Profiler [BASIC]
   |-- elapsed time                      [A]   213.186 milliseconds.
   |-- elapsed time                      [B]  2499.107 milliseconds.
   |-- elapsed time                  [OTHER]  3300.752 milliseconds.
   |-- Total                         [BASIC]  6014.161 milliseconds.
