<p>Simple wrapper API around multiple logging APIs.</p>


<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This package provides an API for logging in server-based applications that
    can be used around a variety of different logging implementations, including
    prebuilt support for the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">Log4J</a> (version 1.2 or later)
        from Apache's Logging project.  Each named <a href="Log.html">Log</a>
        instance is connected to a corresponding Log4J Logger.</li>
    <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/util/logging/index.html">
        JDK Logging API</a>, included in JDK 1.4 or later systems.  Each named
        <a href="Log.html">Log</a> instance is connected to a corresponding
        <code>java.util.logging.Logger</code> instance.</li>
    <li><a href="http://avalon.apache.org/logkit/">LogKit</a> from Apache's
        Avalon project.  Each named <a href="Log.html">Log</a> instance is
        connected to a corresponding LogKit <code>Logger</code>.</li>
    <li><a href="impl/NoOpLog.html">NoOpLog</a> implementation that simply swallows
        all log output, for all named <a href="Log.html">Log</a> instances.</li>
    <li><a href="impl/SimpleLog.html">SimpleLog</a> implementation that writes all
        log output, for all named <a href="Log.html">Log</a> instances, to
        System.err.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Quick Start Guide</h3>

<p>For those impatient to just get on with it, the following example
    illustrates the typical declaration and use of a logger that is named (by
    convention) after the calling class:

<pre>
    import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
    import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;

    public class Foo {

        private Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Foo.class);

        public void foo() {
            ...
            try {
                if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
                    log.debug("About to do something to object " + name);
                }
                name.bar();
            } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
                log.error("Something bad happened to " + name, e);
            }
            ...
        }
</pre>

<p>Unless you configure things differently, all log output will be written
    to System.err.  Therefore, you really will want to review the remainder of
    this page in order to understand how to configure logging for your
    application.</p>


<h3>Configuring the Commons Logging Package</h3>


<h4>Choosing a <code>LogFactory</code> Implementation</h4>

<p>From an application perspective, the first requirement is to retrieve an
    object reference to the <code>LogFactory</code> instance that will be used
    to create <code><a href="Log.html">Log</a></code> instances for this
    application.  This is normally accomplished by calling the static
    <code>getFactory()</code> method.  This method implements the following
    discovery algorithm to select the name of the <code>LogFactory</code>
    implementation class this application wants to use:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check for a system property named
        <code>org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory</code>.</li>
    <li>Use the JDK 1.3 JAR Services Discovery mechanism (see
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jar/jar.html">
            http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jar/jar.html</a> for
        more information) to look for a resource named
        <code>META-INF/services/org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory</code>
        whose first line is assumed to contain the desired class name.</li>
    <li>Look for a properties file named <code>commons-logging.properties</code>
        visible in the application class path, with a property named
        <code>org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory</code> defining the
        desired implementation class name.</li>
    <li>Fall back to a default implementation, which is described
        further below.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <code>commons-logging.properties</code> file is found, all of the
    properties defined there are also used to set configuration attributes on
    the instantiated <code>LogFactory</code> instance.</p>

<p>Once an implementation class name is selected, the corresponding class is
    loaded from the current Thread context class loader (if there is one), or
    from the class loader that loaded the <code>LogFactory</code> class itself
    otherwise.  This allows a copy of <code>commons-logging.jar</code> to be
    shared in a multiple class loader environment (such as a servlet container),
    but still allow each web application to provide its own <code>LogFactory</code>
    implementation, if it so desires.  An instance of this class will then be
    created, and cached per class loader.


<h4>The Default <code>LogFactory</code> Implementation</h4>

<p>The Logging Package APIs include a default <code>LogFactory</code>
    implementation class (<a href="impl/LogFactoryImpl.html">
        org.apache.commons.logging.impl.LogFactoryImpl</a>) that is selected if no
    other implementation class name can be discovered.  Its primary purpose is
    to create (as necessary) and return <a href="Log.html">Log</a> instances
    in response to calls to the <code>getInstance()</code> method.  The default
    implementation uses the following rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>At most one <code>Log</code> instance of the same name will be created.
        Subsequent <code>getInstance()</code> calls to the same
        <code>LogFactory</code> instance, with the same name or <code>Class</code>
        parameter, will return the same <code>Log</code> instance.</li>
    <li>When a new <code>Log</code> instance must be created, the default
        <code>LogFactory</code> implementation uses the following discovery
        process:
        <ul>
            <li>Look for a configuration attribute of this factory named
                <code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log</code> (for backwards
                compatibility to pre-1.0 versions of this API, an attribute
                <code>org.apache.commons.logging.log</code> is also consulted).</li>
            <li>Look for a system property named
                <code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log</code> (for backwards
                compatibility to pre-1.0 versions of this API, a system property
                <code>org.apache.commons.logging.log</code> is also consulted).</li>
            <li>If the Log4J logging system is available in the application
                class path, use the corresponding wrapper class
                (<a href="impl/Log4JLogger.html">Log4JLogger</a>).</li>
            <li>If the application is executing on a JDK 1.4 system, use
                the corresponding wrapper class
                (<a href="impl/Jdk14Logger.html">Jdk14Logger</a>).</li>
            <li>Fall back to the default simple logging implementation
                (<a href="impl/SimpleLog.html">SimpleLog</a>).</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Load the class of the specified name from the thread context class
        loader (if any), or from the class loader that loaded the
        <code>LogFactory</code> class otherwise.</li>
    <li>Instantiate an instance of the selected <code>Log</code>
        implementation class, passing the specified name as the single
        argument to its constructor.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="impl/SimpleLog.html">SimpleLog</a> JavaDocs for detailed
    configuration information for this default implementation.</p>


<h4>Configuring the Underlying Logging System</h4>

<p>The basic principle is that the user is totally responsible for the
    configuration of the underlying logging system.
    Commons-logging should not change the existing configuration.</p>

<p>Each individual <a href="Log.html">Log</a> implementation may
    support its own configuration properties.  These will be documented in the
    class descriptions for the corresponding implementation class.</p>

<p>Finally, some <code>Log</code> implementations (such as the one for Log4J)
    require an external configuration file for the entire logging environment.
    This file should be prepared in a manner that is specific to the actual logging
    technology being used.</p>


<h3>Using the Logging Package APIs</h3>

<p>Use of the Logging Package APIs, from the perspective of an application
    component, consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Acquire a reference to an instance of
        <a href="Log.html">org.apache.commons.logging.Log</a>, by calling the
        factory method
        <a href="LogFactory.html#getInstance(java.lang.String)">
            LogFactory.getInstance(String name)</a>.  Your application can contain
        references to multiple loggers that are used for different
        purposes.  A typical scenario for a server application is to have each
        major component of the server use its own Log instance.</li>
    <li>Cause messages to be logged (if the corresponding detail level is enabled)
        by calling appropriate methods (<code>trace()</code>, <code>debug()</code>,
        <code>info()</code>, <code>warn()</code>, <code>error</code>, and
        <code>fatal()</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>For convenience, <code>LogFactory</code> also offers a static method
    <code>getLog()</code> that combines the typical two-step pattern:</p>
<pre>
  Log log = LogFactory.getFactory().getInstance(Foo.class);
</pre>
<p>into a single method call:</p>
<pre>
  Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Foo.class);
</pre>

<p>For example, you might use the following technique to initialize and
    use a <a href="Log.html">Log</a> instance in an application component:</p>
<pre>
import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;

public class MyComponent {

  protected Log log =
    LogFactory.getLog(MyComponent.class);

  // Called once at startup time
  public void start() {
    ...
    log.info("MyComponent started");
    ...
  }

  // Called once at shutdown time
  public void stop() {
    ...
    log.info("MyComponent stopped");
    ...
  }

  // Called repeatedly to process a particular argument value
  // which you want logged if debugging is enabled
  public void process(String value) {
    ...
    // Do the string concatenation only if logging is enabled
    if (log.isDebugEnabled())
      log.debug("MyComponent processing " + value);
    ...
  }

}
</pre>
