    <title>OSGi Log Service Specification implemented with SLF4J</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    This bundle implements the full OSGi Log service specification (r4.2.0) and sends OSGi log events to SLF4J. To use,
    simply add this jar bundle
    to your OSGi container and it will register <a
        href="https://osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/log/LogService.html">LogService</a>
    and <a href="https://osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/log/LogReaderService.html">LogReaderService</a>
    implementations.
</p>
The LogReaderService can be configured with Config Admin UI and shell plugins. The two configuration aspects are:
<dl>
    <dt>maxSize</dt>
    <dd>How many LogEntries will be stored in the list of entries. This list keeps only the most-recent entries. Default
        is 100.
    </dd>
    <dt>storeDebug</dt>
    <dd>Should DEBUG entries be stored in the list of entries. Default is false. NOTE: LogEntry listeners will still get
        DEBUG LogEntry notifications
        regardless of the value of this setting. This is per-spec behavior.
    </dd>
</dl>
If Event Admin is available in the OSGi container, this bundle will also send Log events to it as per the OSGi Log
Service spec.
