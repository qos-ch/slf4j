    <h2>SLF4J user manual</h2>
    
    <p>The Simple Logging Facade for Java or (SLF4J) serves as a
    simple facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks, e.g.
    java.util.logging, log4j and logback, allowing the end-user to
    plug in the desired logging framework at <em>deployment</em> time.
    </p>
      
    <h3>
      <a name="hello_world" href="#hello_world">Hello World</a>
    </h3>

    <p>In accordance with programming tradition, here is an example
    illustrating the simplest way to output "Hello world" using SLF4J.
    It begins by getting a logger with the name "HelloWorld". This
    logger is in turn used to log the message "Hello World". 
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint source">import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HelloWorld.class);
    logger.info("Hello World");
  }
}</pre>

     <p>To run this example, you first need to <a
     href="download.html">download the slf4j distribution</a>, and
     then to unpack it. Once that is done, add these two jar files to
     your class path:</p>

     <ul>
       <li>slf4j-api-${project.version}.jar</li>
       <li>slf4j-simple-${project.version}.jar</li>
     </ul>

     <p>Compiling and running <em>HelloWorld</em> will result in the
     following output being printed on the console.</p>

     <pre class="output">0 [main] INFO HelloWorld - Hello World</pre>
      
     <h3>
       <a name="typical_usage" href="#typical_usage">Typical usage
       pattern</a>
     </h3>
 
     <p>The sample code below illustrates the typical usage pattern
     for SLF4J. Note the use of {}-placeholders on line 15. See the
     question <a href="faq.html#logging_performance">"What is the
     fastest way of logging?"</a> in the FAQ for more details.
     </p>
     
     <p></p>

      <pre class="prettyprint source"> 1: <b>import org.slf4j.Logger;</b>
 2: <b>import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;</b>

      <h3><a name="swapping" href="#binding">Binding with a logging
      framework at deployment time</a></h3>

      <p>As mentioned previously, SLF4J supports multiple logging
      frameworks. The SLF4J distribution ships with several jar files
      referred to as "SLF4J bindings".  </p>

      <dl>

        <dt><em>slf4j-nop-${project.version}.jar</em></dt>
        <dd>Binding for <a
        href="http://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/helpers/NOPLogger.html">NOP</a>,
        silently discarding all logging.<p/></dd>
        
        
        <dt><em>slf4j-simple-${project.version}.jar</em></dt>
        <dd>Binding for <a
        href="http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/impl/SimpleLogger.html">Simple
        </a> implementation, which outputs all events to
        System.err. Only messages of level INFO and higher are
        printed. This binding may be useful in the context of small
        applications.<p/></dd>

        <dt><em>slf4j-log4j12-${project.version}.jar</em>
        </dt>
        <dd>Binding for <a
        href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html">log4j
        version 1.2</a>, a widely used logging framework. You also
        need to place <em>log4j.jar</em> on your class path.<p/></dd>

        <dt><em>slf4j-jdk14-${project.version}.jar</em> </dt>
        <dd>Binding for java.util.logging, also referred to as JDK 1.4
        logging (<a
        href="http://www.exampledepot.com/egs/java.util.logging/pkg.html">examples</a>)<p/></dd>
        
        <dt><em>slf4j-jcl-${project.version}.jar</em></dt>
        
        <dd>Binding for <a
        href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/">Jakarta Commons
        Logging</a>. This binding will delegate all SLF4J logging to
        JCL.<p/>
        </dd>     
      </dl>

      <p>There are also SLF4J bindings external to the SLF4J project,
      e.g. <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/">logback</a> which
      implements SLF4J natively.  Logback's
      <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/apidocs/ch/qos/logback/classic/Logger.html">
      <code>ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger</code></a> class is a direct 	 
      implementation of SLF4J's 	 
      <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/Logger.html"> 	 
      <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code></a> interface. Thus, using SLF4J
      in conjunction with logback involves strictly zero memory and
      computational overhead.
      </p> 	 
	 

      <p>To switch logging frameworks, just replace slf4j bindings on
      your class path. For example, to switch from java.util.logging
      to log4j, just replace slf4j-jdk14-${project.version}.jar with
      slf4j-log4j12-${project.version}.jar.
      </p>

      <p>SLF4J does not rely on any special class loader machinery. In
      fact, the each SLF4J binding is hardwired <em>at compile
      time</em> to use one and only one specific logging framework.
      For example, the slf4j-log12-${project.version}.jar binding is
      bound at compile time to use log4j.  In your code, in addition
      to <em>slf4j-api-${project.version}.jar</em>, you simply drop
      <b>one and only one</b> binding of your choice onto the
      appropriate class path location. Do not place more than one
      binding on your class path. Here is a graphical illustration of
      the general idea.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      </a></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>


      <p>The SLF4J interfaces and their various adapters are extremely
      simple. Most developers familiar with the Java language should
      be able to read and fully understand the code in less than one
      hour.  No knowledge of class loaders is necessary as SLF4J does
      not make use nor does it directly access any class loaders. As a
      consequence, SLF4J suffers from none of the class loader
      problems or memory leaks observed with Jakarta Commons Logging
      (JCL).
      </p>

      <p>Hopefully, the simplicity of the SLF4J interfaces and the
      deployment model will make it easy for developers of other
      logging frameworks to conform to the SLF4J model.
      </p>
     
      <h3><a name="libraries" href="#libraries">Libraries</a></h3>

      <p>Authors of widely-distributed components and libraries may
      code against the SLF4J interface in order to avoid imposing an
      logging framework on the end-user of the component or library.
      He or she may choose the desired logging framework at deployment
      time by inserting the desired slf4j binding on the classpath,
      which may be changed later by replacing an existing binding with
      another on the class path and restarting the application.  This
      approach has proven to be simple and very robust.
      </p>
        

      <h3><a name="consolidate" href="#consolidate">Consolidate
      logging via SLF4J</a></h3>

      <p>Often times, a given project will depend on various
      components which rely on logging APIs other than SLF4J. It is
      common to find projects depending on a combination of JCL,
      java.util.logging, log4j and SLF4J. It then becomes desirable to
      consolidate logging through a single channel. SLF4J caters for
      this common use-case by providing bridging modules for JCL,
      java.util.logging and log4j. For more details, please refer to
      the page on <a href="legacy.html"><b>Bridging legacy
      APIs</b></a>.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="mdc" href="#mdc">Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)
      support</a></h3>
      <p>"Mapped Diagnostic Context" is essentially a map maintained by the
      logging framework where the application can provided key-value pairs,
      which can then be inserted by the logging framework in log messages.</p>

      <p>SLF4J supports MDC, or mapped diagnostic context. If the
      underlying logging framework offers MDC functionality, then
      SLF4J will delegate to the underlying framework's MDC. Note that
      at this time, only log4j and logback offer MDC functionality. If
      the underlying framework does not offer MDC, for example
      java.util.logging, then SLF4J will still store MDC data but the
      information therein will need to be retrieved by custom user
      code.</p>

      <p>Thus, as a SLF4J user, you can take advantage of MDC
      information in the presence of log4j or logback, but without
      forcing these logging frameworks upon your users as
      dependencies.
      </p>

      <p>For more information on MDC please see the <a
      href="http://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html">chapter on MDC</a>
      in the logback manual.
