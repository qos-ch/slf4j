    </h3>

    <p>This <code>IllegalStateException</code> is thrown
    post-initialization and informs the user that initialization of
    <code>LoggerFactory</code> has failed.</p>

    <p><span class="label notice">Note</span> It is important to
    realize that the exception causing the failure was thrown at an
    <b>earlier stage</b>. This earlier exception should provide more

    <h3 class="doAnchor" name="release">The method
    <code>o.a.commons.logging.impl.SLF4FLogFactory#release</code> was
    invoked.      
    </h3>

    <p>Given the structure of the commons-logging API, in particular
    as implemented by SLF4J, the
    <code>o.a.commons.logging.impl.SLF4FLogFactory#release()</code>
    method should never be called. However, depending on the
    deployment of <em>commons-logging.jar</em> files in your servlet
    container, <code>release()</code> method may be unexpectedly
    invoked by a copy of
    <code>org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory</code> class shipping
    with <em>commons-logging.jar</em>.
    </p>

    <p>This is a relatively common occurrence with recent versions of
    Tomcat, especially if you place <em>jcl-over-slf4j.jar</em> in
    <em>WEB-INF/lib</em> directory of your web-application instead of
    <em>$TOMCAT_HOME/common/lib</em>, where $TOMCAT_HOME stands for
    the directory where Tomcat is installed. In order to fully benefit
    from the stability offered by <em>jcl-over-slf4j.jar</em>, we
    recommend that you place <em>jcl-over-slf4j.jar</em> in
    <em>$TOMCAT_HOME/common/lib</em> without placing a copy in your
    web-applications.

    <h3 class="doAnchor" name="unsupported_operation_in_jcl_over_slf4j">Operation
    [suchAndSuch] is not supported in jcl-over-slf4j.
    </h3>

    <p>An <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> is thrown whenever
    one of the protected methods introduced in JCL 1.1 are
    invoked. These methods are invoked by <code>LogFactory</code>
    implementations shipping with
    <em>commons-logging.jar</em>. However, the <code>LogFactory</code>
    implemented by <em>jcl-over-slf4j.jar</em>, namely
    SLF4FLogFactory, does not call any of these methods.
    </p>

    <p>If you observe this problem, then it is highly probable that you
    have a copy of <em>commons-logging.jar</em> in your class path
    overriding the classes shipping with
    <em>jcl-over-slf4j.jar</em>. Note that this issue is very similar
    in nature to the warning issued when the
    "o.a.commons.logging.impl.SLF4FLogFactory.release()" method is
    invoked, discussed in the previous item.
    </p>

    <!-- ====================================================== -->
    <h3 class="doAnchor" name="loggerNameMismatch">Detected logger
    name mismatch</h3>

    <p>Logger name mismatch warnings are printed only if the
    <code>slf4j.detectLoggerNameMismatch</code> system property is set
    to true. By default, this property is not set and no warnings will
    be printed even in case of a logger name mismatch.
    </p>

    <p><span class="label">since 1.7.9</span> The warning will
    be printed in case the name of the logger specified via a class
    passed as an argument to the
    <code>LoggerFactory.getLogger(Class)</code> method differs from
    the name of the caller as computed internally by SLF4J.
    </p>

    <p>For example, the following code snippet</p> 

<pre class="prettyprint source">package com.acme;
import com.foo.Kangaroo;

class <b>Fruit</b> {
  Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(<b>Kangaroo.class</b>);
}</pre>

    <p>will result in the warning</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint source">SLF4J: Detected logger name mismatch. Given name: "com.foo.Kangaroo"; computed name: "com.acme.Fruit".</pre>
    
    <p>but only if <code>slf4j.detectLoggerNameMismatch</code> system
    property is set to true.</p>
    
    <p>No warning will be issued for the special case where the class
    in which the logger is defined is a super-type of the class
    parameter passed as argument. For example,</p>
    
    <pre class="prettyprint source">class A { 
    Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass()); 
}
class B extends A { 
    // no mismatch warning will be issued when B is instantiated 
    // given that class A is a super-type of class B
}</pre>

    <p>If you come across a mismatch warning which cannot be
    explained, then you might have spotted a white elephant, that is a
    very rare occurrence where SLF4J cannot correctly compute the name
    of the class where a logger is defined. We are very interested to
    learn about such cases. If and when you spot an inexplicable
    mismatch, please do file a <a href="bug-reporting.html">bug
    report</a> with us.

    <h3 class="doAnchor" name="StaticLoggerBinder">Failed to load class
    <code>org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder</code></h3>
    
    <p>This warning message is reported when the
    <code>org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder</code> class could not be
    loaded into memory.  This happens when no appropriate SLF4J
    binding could be found on the class path. Placing one (and only
    one) of <em>slf4j-nop.jar</em> <em>slf4j-simple.jar</em>,
    <em>slf4j-log4j12.jar</em>, <em>slf4j-jdk14.jar</em> or
    <em>logback-classic.jar</em> on the class path should solve the
    problem.
    </p>

    <p><span class="label">since 1.6.0</span> As of SLF4J version 1.6,
    in the absence of a binding, SLF4J will default to a no-operation
    (NOP) logger implementation.
    </p>
    
    <p>If you are responsible for packaging an application and do not
    care about logging, then placing <em>slf4j-nop.jar</em> on the
    class path of your application will get rid of this warning
    message. Note that embedded components such as libraries or
    frameworks should not declare a dependency on any SLF4J binding
    but only depend on slf4j-api. When a library declares a
    compile-time dependency on a SLF4J binding, it imposes that
    binding on the end-user, thus negating SLF4J's purpose. </p>

    <p>From a broader perspective, this issue is a manifestation of

    <h3 class="doAnchor" name="multiple_bindings">Multiple bindings
    were found on the class path
    </h3>


    <p>SLF4J API is designed to bind with one and only one underlying
    logging framework at a time. If more than one binding is present
    on the class path, SLF4J will emit a warning, listing the location
    of those bindings.</p>

    <p>When multiple bindings are available on the class path, select
    one and only one binding you wish to use, and remove the other
    bindings. For example, if you have both
    <em>slf4j-simple-${version}.jar</em> and
    <em>slf4j-nop-${version}.jar</em> on the class path and you wish
    to use the nop (no-operation) binding, then remove
    <em>slf4j-simple-${version}.jar</em> from the class path. 
    </p>

    <p>The list of locations that SLF4J provides in this warning
    usually provides sufficient information to identify the dependency
    transitively pulling in an unwanted SLF4J binding into your
    project. In your project's pom.xml file, exclude this SLF4J
    binding when declaring the unscrupulous dependency. For example,
    <em>cassandra-all</em> version 0.8.1 declares both <em>log4j</em>
    and <em>slf4j-log4j12</em> as compile-time dependencies. Thus,
    when you include <em>cassandra-all</em> as a dependency in your
    project, the <em>cassandra-all</em> declaration will cause both
    <em>slf4j-log4j12.jar</em> and <em>log4j.jar</em> to be pulled in
    as dependencies. In case you do not wish to use log4j as the the
    SLF4J backend, you can instruct Maven to exclude these two
    artifacts as shown next:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;dependencies>
  &lt;dependency>
    &lt;groupId> org.apache.cassandra&lt;/groupId>
    &lt;artifactId>cassandra-all&lt;/artifactId>
    &lt;version>0.8.1&lt;/version>

    &lt;exclusions>
      &lt;exclusion> 
        &lt;groupId>org.slf4j&lt;/groupId>
        &lt;artifactId>slf4j-log4j12&lt;/artifactId>
      &lt;/exclusion>
      &lt;exclusion> 
        &lt;groupId>log4j&lt;/groupId>
        &lt;artifactId>log4j&lt;/artifactId>
      &lt;/exclusion>
    &lt;/exclusions> 

  &lt;/dependency>
&lt;/dependencies></pre>

   <p><span class="label notice">Note</span> The warning emitted by
   SLF4J is just that, a warning. Even when multiple bindings are
   present, SLF4J will pick one logging framework/implementation and
   bind with it. The way SLF4J picks a binding is determined by the
   JVM and for all practical purposes should be considered random. As
   of version 1.6.6, SLF4J will name the framework/implementation
   class it is actually bound to.</p>

   <p>Embedded components such as libraries or frameworks should not
   declare a dependency on any SLF4J binding but only depend on
   slf4j-api. When a library declares a compile-time dependency on a
   SLF4J binding, it imposes that binding on the end-user, thus
   negating SLF4J's purpose. When you come across an embedded
   component declaring a compile-time dependency on any SLF4J binding,
   please take the time to contact the authors of said
   component/library and kindly ask them to mend their ways.</p>
  
    <!-- ====================================================== -->

    <h3 class="doAnchor" name="version_mismatch">slf4j-api version
    does not match that of the binding</h3>

    <p>An SLF4J binding designates an artifact such as
    <em>slf4j-jdk14.jar</em> or <em>slf4j-log4j12.jar</em> used to
    <em>bind</em> slf4j to an underlying logging framework, say,
    java.util.logging and respectively log4j.
    </p>

    <p>Mixing mixing different versions of <em>slf4j-api.jar</em> and
    SLF4J binding can cause problems. For example, if you are using
    slf4j-api-${project.version}.jar, then you should also use
    slf4j-simple-${project.version}.jar, using slf4j-simple-1.5.5.jar
    will not work.</p>

    <p><span class="label notice">Note</span> From the client's
    perspective all versions of slf4j-api are compatible. Client code
    compiled with <em>slf4j-api-N.jar</em> will run perfectly fine
    with <em>slf4j-api-M.jar</em> for any N and M. You only need to
    ensure that the version of your binding matches that of the
    slf4j-api.jar. You do not have to worry about the version of
    slf4j-api.jar used by a given dependency in your project. You
    can always use any version of <em>slf4j-api.jar</em>, and as long
    as the version of <em>slf4j-api.jar</em> and its binding match,
    you should be fine.
    </p>

    <p>At initialization time, if SLF4J suspects that there may be a
    api vs. binding version mismatch problem, it will emit a warning
    about the suspected mismatch.

    <p> Highly configurable
    logging systems such as logback and log4j may create components
    which invoke loggers during their own initialization.  See issue
    <a href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-127">LOGBACK-127</a>
    for a typical occurrence. However, since the binding process with
    SLF4J has not yet completed (because the underlying logging system
    was not yet completely loaded into memory), it is not possible to
    honor such logger creation requests.</p>

    <p>To avoid this chicken-and-egg problem, SLF4J creates substitute
    loggers during this phase (initialization). Calls made to the
    substitute loggers during this phase are simply dropped. After the
    initialization completes, the substitute logger will delegate
    logging calls to the appropriate logger implementation and
    otherwise will function as any other logger returned by
    <code>LoggerFactory</code>.
    </p>
  
    <p>If any substitute logger had to be created, SLF4J will emit a a

    <p>Placing <em>slf4j-api.jar</em> version 1.7.15 or later in the
    classpath should solve the issue.</p>
    
    <p>Note that this problem only occurs with logback version 1.1.4
    and later, other bindings such as slf4j-log4j, slf4j-jdk14 and
    slf4j-simple are unaffected.
