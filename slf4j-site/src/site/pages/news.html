  <h3>June 8th, 2008 - Release of SLF4J 1.5.2</h3>

  <p>Improvements to SLF4J documentation as well as fix of <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88">packaging
  problems</a> related to <em>jul-to-slf4j.jar</em> and
  <em>jcl104-over-slf4j.jar</em>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>June 5th, 2008 - Release of SLF4J 1.5.1</h3>

  <p>See also the <a href="compatibility.html#1_5_1">compatibility
  report for this version</a>.</p>

  <p>In order to support JCL version 1.1.1, the
  <em>jcl<b>104</b>-over-slf4j</em> module was renamed as
  <em>jcl-over-slf4j</em>. SLF4J will no longer ship with
  <em>jcl104-over-slf4j.jar</em> but with <em>jcl-over-slf4j.jar</em>.
  The related work responds to enhancement request discussed in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85">bug 85</a> as
  reported by Niklas Gustavsson.
  </p>
  
  <p>The <em>slf4j-jcl</em> binding now depends on commons-logging
  version 1.1.1 instead of the older 1.0.4</p>


  <p>Added a java.util.logging to SLF4J bridge as requested in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38">bug 38</a> by
  Christian Stein, David Smiley, Johan Ferner, Joern Huxhorn and
  others.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68">bug
  68</a> reported by Su Chuan and David Rauschenbach. SLF4J requires
  log4j 1.2.12 or later. However, if an older version of log4j is
  present (lacking the TRACE level), in order to avoid
  NoSuchMethodError exceptions, the SLF4J's
  <code>Log4jLoggerAdapter</code> will map the TRACE level as DEBUG.
  </p>

  
  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78">bug
  78</a> reported by Venu Thachappilly. If the argument array passed
  to a Logger printing method (debug, info, etc.) was null, a
  <code>NullPointerException</code> was thrown. With the correction,
  the messagePattern is returned as is, without parameter
  substitution.
  </p>


  <p>Added the <code>getCopyOfContextMap</code> and
  <code>setContextMap</code> methods to the <code>MDCAdapter</code>
  and <code>org.sf4j.MDC</code> classes. This was requested in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84">bug 84</a> by
  Anton Tagunov.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74">bug
  74</a>, an endless recursion problem in Marker.contains method,
  reported by Michael Newcomb. Also added he
  <code>getDetachedMarker</code> method to <code>IMarkerFactor</code>
  and <code>MarkerFactory</code> classes which was indirectly
  requested in bug 74.
  </p>

  <p>Added the methods <code>getLevel()</code> and
  <code>getEffectiveLevel()</code> to the <code>Category</code> class
  in log4j-over-slf4j. This addition was requested in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74">bug 74</a> by
  Michael Newcomb.
  </p>

  <p>The <a href="migrator.html">SLF4J Migrator</a>
  tool has been improved to support migration from JUL to SLF4J.
  </p>

  <p>In <code>MarkerIgnoringBase</code> class, corrected mapping of
  trace methods with markers to their equivalents without marker
  data. Previously, the mapping was trace to debug. The incorrect
  mapping affected only calls to the trace method with
  markers. Interestingly enough, this bug was picked up by new unit
  tests and has not been reported as a bug by our users.
  </p>
  

  <h3>February 26th, 2008 - Release of SLF4J 1.5.0</h3>


  <p>A tool called <a href="migrator.html">SLF4J Migrator</a> now
  ships with SLF4J. It can help you migrate your project using JCL or
  log4j to use SLF4J instead.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61">bug
  61</a> reported by Christopher Sahnwaldt. It is now possible to
  place a backslash in front of a formatting anchor, by escaping the
  backslash. For example, the call to
  <code>MessageFormatter.format("C:\\\\{}", "foo")</code> will now
  correctly return "C:\\foo". The backslash character needs to be
  escaped in Java, which leads to four backslashes.
  </p>

 
  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=63">bug
  63</a> reported by Maarten Bosteels. SLF4J now supports MDC for
  <code>java.util.logging</code> package.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64">bug
  64</a> reported by Michal Bernhard. The log4j binding will now alert
  the user if she uses SLF4J with a version of log4j earlier than 1.2.12.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=65">bug
  65</a> reported by Ben Gidley. Superfluous
  &lt;version>$&#x7B;parent.version}&lt;/version> lines have been
  removed from pom.xml files. These lines reportedly confuse certain
  Maven repositories.
  </p>

  <p>In the <code>org.apache.log4j.Category</code> class, as
  implemented in the log4j-over-slf4j module, calls to the printing
  trace() are now correctly mapped to SLF4J's trace() printing method
  (instead of debug()). Superfluous printing methods with the
  signature <code>xxxx(Object, Object)</code> and <code>xxxx(String,
  Object, Object)</code> have been removed.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67">bug
  67</a> reported by Chris Custine.  The manifest file for
  jcl104-over-slf4j now correctly declares version 1.0.4 for the
  exported JCL packages.
  </p>


  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69">bug
  69</a> reported by Joern Huxhorn, who graciously supplied the fix as
  well as a test case. The <code>add</code> method in
  <code>BasicMarker</code> class now correctly prevents multiple
  addition of the same child. Moreover, the <code>remove</code> method
  now correctly removes the specified child marker.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41">bug
  41</a> reported by Sebastian Davids. The manifest files of various
  projects now mention J2SE-1.3 as the required execution
  environment.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=71">bug
  71</a> reported by Manfred Geiler. The SLF4JLog and
  SLF4JLocationAwareLog classes are now serializable solving
  serialization problems encountered with certain libraries which
  attempt to serialize JCL log instances.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73">bug
  73</a> reported by Oleg Smirsky. A "Fragment-Host: slf4j.api" line
  has been added to every MANIFEST.MF file exporting
  <code>org.slf4j.impl</code>.
  </p>


  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72">bug
  72</a> reported by Ian Carr. Performance issues with slf4j-jdk14 for
  disabled log statements have now been corrected.
  </p>

  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>August 20th, 2007 - Release of SLF4J 1.4.3</h3>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60">bug
  60</a> as reported by Costin Leau. OSGI manifest entries now declare
  the correct SLF4J version.
  </p>
  
  <p>Clarified the behavior of the various methods methods in the MDC
  class with respect to "null" parameters. This was requested in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58">bug 58</a> by
  Sebastian Davids.
  </p>

  <p>Removed the slf4j-archetype module because nobody seems to have a
  use for it.</p>

  <h3>July 12th, 2007 - Release of SLF4J 1.4.2</h3>

  <p>The <a href="log4j-over-slf4j.html">log4j-over-slf4j</a> module
  has been moved back into SLF4J. Originally, this module was part of
  SLF4J and was moved into logback due to the lack of MDC support in
  SLF4J. With version 1.4.2 and the addition of MDC support in SLF4J
  1.4.1, log4j-over-slf4j returns to its original home. Note that the
  previous name of the module was <a
  href="http://logback.qos.ch/bridge.html">log4j-bridge</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Addition of the <code>getMDCAdapter</code> method to
  org.slf4j.MDC class. This allows access to the actual MDC
  implementation which can on occasion come in very handy.
  </p>

  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>



  <h3>July 4th, 2007 - Release of SLF4J 1.4.1</h3>


  <p>SLF4J now supports <a href="manual.html#mdc">Mapped Diagnostic
  Contexts</a> (MDC) as requested by Andy Gerweck and Steve Ebersole
  in <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49">bug
  49</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53">bug
  53</a> as reported by Heinrich Nirschl.  The public method
  <code>trace(String)</code> in the <code>Log4jLoggerAdapter</code>
  class incorrecly called the underlying log4j logger with level DEBUG
  instead of TRACE.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed various documentation related errors kindly reported by
  Mark Vedder.
  </p>


  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>


  <h3>May 16th, 2007 - Release of SLF4J 1.4.0</h3>


  <p>In response to many user requests over time, the TRACE level has
  been added to <a
  href="api/org/slf4j/Logger.html">org.slf4j.Logger</a>
  interface. Please also see the <a href="faq.html#trace">FAQ entry
  discussing</a> the TRACE level.
  </p>


  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47">bug
  47</a> as reported by Terry Todd.  In previous a SLF4J release the
  <code>org.apache.commons.logging.impl.SLF4FLogFactory</code> class
  was renamed as <code>SLF4JLogFactory</code>. The
  <em>META-INF/services/org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory</em>
  resource file had not reflected this change. It does now.
  </p>


  <p>Eric Yung <a
  href="http://www.slf4j.org/pipermail/user/2007-April/000327.html">reported</a>
  that Apache commons-configuration access certain commons-logging
  classes, namely <code>org.apache.commons.logging.impl.NoOpLog</code>
  and SimpleLog, directly. Following Eric's suggestion,
  jcl104-over-slf4j now includes the aforementioned classes.
  </p>
  

  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>April 15th, 2007 - Release of SLF4J 1.3.1</h3>


  <p>In response to a <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39">enhancement
  request</a> made by Michael Newcomb, a marker can now be detached
  from the internal list of the <code>MarkerFactory</code> that
  generated it.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed a silly but nonetheless annoying bug where log request of
  level ERROR made through jcl104-over-slf4j would log twice. This bug
  was <a
  href="http://www.slf4j.org/pipermail/user/2007-April/000323.html">reported</a>
  and precisely described by Andrew Cooke.
  </p>


  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>February 25th, 2007 - Release of SLF4J 1.3.0</h3>

  <p>This release consists of rearrangement of classes among
  projects. More specifically, the
  <code>org.slf4j.LoggerFactory</code> class is now packaged within
  the <em>slf4j-api.jar</em> file instead of the various slf4j
  bindings. <b>It follows that client code needs to depend on only
  slf4j-api in order to compile, while the various slf4j bindings are
  only needed as runtime dependencies.</b> See also the <a
  href="faq.html#maven2">Maven2-related FAQ entry</a>. Given the
  practical significance of this change, we highly recommend that
  library-authors upgrade to version 1.3 at their earliest
  convenience. 
  </p>
  
  <p><a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23">Bug number
  23</a> has been fixed, at the cost of minor and backward compatible
  changes. In other words, jcl104-over-slf4j now preserves caller
  location information.
  </p>
  
  <p>It is now possible to obtain the root logger of the underlying
  logging implementation by requesting a logger named
  &quot;ROOT&quot;. This feature was requested by Sebastien Davids
  in <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35">bug
  report 35</a>. </p>

  <p>For  an   exact  list   of  changes  please   refer  to   the  <a
  href="changes/changes-1.3.txt">1.3.0  compatibility  report</a> file
  as generated by clirr.</p>

  
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>January 24th, 2007 - Release of SLF4J 1.2</h3>
  <p>This release includes several modifications to make SLF4J
  an <a href="http://www.osgi.org/">OSGi</a>-friendly framework. 
  The modules' MANIFEST.MF files now include
  OSGi metadata. Regarding these improvements, and OSGi in general, the
  SLF4J project is happy to welcome John E. Conlon  as a new committer.
  </p> 
  
  <p>Marker objects are now Serializable.
  </p>
  
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>December 21st, 2006 - Release of SLF4J 1.1.0 (final)</h3>

  <p>This release consists of minor bug fixes and documentation
  changes. More importantly, the log4j-over-slf4j module has been
  moved to the logback project, under the name <a
  href="http://logback.qos.ch/bridge.html">log4j-bridge</a>.
  </p> 

   <p>Added the file "org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory" under
   META-INF/services directory which went missing in the 1.1.0 series
   of SLF4J. This fixes a compatibility problem with Apache Axis which
   uses its own discovery mechanism, namely, commons-discovery version
   0.2. The problem was reported in bug <a
   href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33">report 33</a>
   by David Varnes.
  </p>

  <p>The file jcl104-over-slf4j.jar had various entries missing in its
  MANIFEST.MF file, as reported by Boris Unkel in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30">bug number
  30</a>.
  </p>

  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>November 16th, 2006 - Release of SLF4J 1.1.0-RC1</h3>

  <p>This release consists of packaging related bug fix in addition to
  minor documentation changes.  
  </p> 
  
  <p>Contrary to RC0, RC1 no longer uses SNAPSHOT versions for the
  slf4j-parent pom. The solution to <a
  href="http://ceki.blogspot.com/2006/11/solution-to-maven2-version-number.html">Maven
  version problem</a> does not work for public projects such as SLF4J
  because SNAPHOTs are not allowed on ibiblio.
  </p>


  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>November 4th, 2006 - Release of SLF4J 1.1.0-RC0</h3>

  <p>This release consists of bug fixes. Moreover, since the major
  packaging related changes in 1.1.0-beta0 seem to work well, this
  release is marked as RC0.</p>

  <p>Fixed the JDK 1.5 dependency for the SLF4J build, as reported by
  Boris Unkel in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28">bug number
  28</a>. SLF4J now explicitly declares a dependency on JDK 1.4 in its
  pom.xml file.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed an incorrect reference to the logback project in slf4j-api
  pom file. This bug was reported by Boris Unkel in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29">bug number
  29</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed a syncroisation problem in factories of almost all SLF4J
  bindings. This bug was reported independenly by Howard M. Lewis Ship
  and Boris Unkel in bug reports <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26">26</a> and
  respectively <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26">27</a>.
  </p>

  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>September 7th, 2006 - Release of SLF4J 1.1.0-beta0</h3>

  <p>Release 1.1.0-beta0 is a relatively important release with a
  refactoring of the way class files are organized in jar files. In
  previous releases, each binding was self-contained in a single jar
  file. In this release, each and every binding depends on
  <em>slf4j-api.jar</em> which contains the bulk of the classes
  required to use SLF4J, except for one or two adapter classes.  Only
  the adapter classes are now shipped with each specific binding jar
  as appropriate for the underlying logging system..
  </p>

  <p>This release is built using Maven instead of Ant. As for the java
  code, it has not been changed.</p>
    
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>June 8th, 2006 - Release of SLF4J 1.0.2</h3>

  <p>Release 1.0.2 is a maintenance release containing bug fixes
  only.</p>

  <ul>

    <li>Fixed <a
    href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22">bug number
    22</a> reported by Bjorn Danielsson. This version of the SLF4J API
    will no longer systematically throw an exception when the
    <code>o.a.c.l.impl.SLF4FLogFactory#release()</code> method is
    invoked. Instead, the <code>release()</code> method will issue a
    <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html">warning</a>.

    </li>

  </ul>

  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>May 1st, 2006 - Release of SLF4J 1.0.1</h3>

  <p>Release 1.0.1 is a maintenance release containing bug fixes only.

  <ul>

    <li>Fixed <a
    href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20">bug number
    20</a> reported by Steve Bate. <code>JDK14LoggerAdapter</code>
    will now correctly relay the logger name to the underlying JDK 14
    logging system.
    </li>

    <li>Added the file "org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory" under
    META-INF/services directory in the jcl104-over-slf4j jar
    file. This fixes a compatibility problem with Apache Axis which
    uses its own discovery mechanism, namely, commons-discovery
    version 0.2. The bug was reported by Dave Wallace.
    </li>

  </ul>
  </p>

  
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>March 8th, 2006 - Release of SLF4J 1.0</h3>

  <p>This is release labeled as 1.0 (final) contains few relatively
  minor changes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>As <a
    href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=114063163800004">discussed</a>
    on the slf4j user list, <code>SimpleLogger</code> now directs its
    output to stderr instead of stdout.
    </li>
    
    <li>Modified <code>JDK14LoggerAdapter</code> so that caller
    information is now correctly printed, as reported in <a
    href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13">bug 13</a> by
    Peter Royal.
    </li>

    <li>Minor additions to the Marker interface.</li>

  </ul>
  
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>February 4th, 2006 - Release of SLF4J 1.0-RC6 and NLOG4J
  1.2.22</h3>

  <p>The <code>MarkingLogger</code> interface has been removed and its
  contents merged into <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code>. This change
  should not adversely affect end-users. However, SLF4J bindings need
  to be updated. This has been done for all the bindings shipped with
  SLF4J distribution as well as NLOG4J. As for x4juli, the update is
  planned for its next release.
  </p>

  <p>The merge between the <code>MarkingLogger</code> and
  <code>Logger</code> interfaces has been motivated by the need to
  allow end-users to easily switch between logging systems that
  support markers and those that do not.
  </p>

  <p>Added a default instance to SimpleLoggerFactory to serve as a
  last resort fallback mechanism. This instance is designed to be used
  by a very specific group of users, namely for those developing
  logging systems (e.g. log4j or LOGBack). It is not intended for
  end-users of the SLF4J API.
  </p>

 <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>January 9th, 2006 - Release of SLF4J 1.0-RC5 and NLOG4J
  1.2.21</h3>

  <p>A maintenance release correcting bugs <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11">#11</a> and <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12">#12</a> and in
  general improved resilience to null input parameters across
  implementations. Many thanks to Boris Unckel and Kenneth for
  reporting the null input issue.
  </p>
  
 <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>December 27th, 2005 - Release of SLF4J 1.0-RC4 and NLOG4J
  1.2.20</h3>


  <p>The printing methods in <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface
  now support passing 3 or more parameters in an <code>Object</code>
  array. This was a frequently requested feature missing in previous
  versions of SLF4J.
  </p>

  <p>NLOG4J 1.2.20 reflects the addition of new methods in the
  <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface.</p>

  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>December 8th, 2005 - Release of SLF4J 1.0-RC3</h3>

  <h3>November 28th, 2005 - Release of SLF4J 1.0-RC2</h3>

  <p>In response to a request by Greg Wilkins, this release adds the
  jar file <em>slf4j-jcl.jar</em>, an SLF4J binding for JCL. Please
  read the <a href="manual.html#gradual">gradual migration section</a>
  in the manual for more details.

  <h3>November 21st, 2005 - Release of SLF4J 1.0-RC1</h3>

  <p>A maintenance release correcting bugs <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4">#4</a> and <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5">#5</a>. Many
  thanks to Christian Beil for accurately reporting bug #4.
  </p>
  
  <p>There has been also an effort to minimize the file sizes of the
  various jar files produced by SLF4J, resulting in jar files
  approximately 40% smaller than in version 1.0beta9.
  </p>

  <p>Given that the SLF4J API is now deemed stable, this release is
  marked as RC1, that is release candidate number 1.
  </p>

  <h3>October 19th, 2005 - Release of SLF4J 1.0-beta9</h3>

  <p>The SLF4J distribution now includes two distinct bindings
  <em>slf4j-log4j12.jar</em> and <em>slf4j-log4j13.jar</em> in order
  to differentiate between log4j version 1.2 and version 1.3. This
  distinction is absolutely necessary because log4j 1.2 and 1.3 are
  not run-time compatible, although they are mostly compile-time
  compatible.
  </p>

  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>October 19th, 2005 - Release of SLF4J 1.0-beta8 and NLOG4J 1.2.18</h3>


  <p>Added a new SLF4J binding, <em>slf4j-log4j.jar</em>, intended to
  be used in conjunction with vanilla <em>log4j.jar</em>, as
  distributed by the <a href="http://logging.apache.org">Apache
  Logging Services</a> project. The slf4j-log4j binding is quite
  similar in structure to the JDK 1.4 binding that existed
  previously. 
  </p>

  <p>The slf4j-log4j binding addresses compatibility problems which
  arose when copies of both <em>log4j.jar</em> and <em>nlog4j.jar</em>
  lay on the class path, in particular when it was undesirable or
  impossible to remove the preexisting <em>log4j.jar</em> file.
  </p>

  <p>Methods in the <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface related to
  markers were moved to a separate super interface called <a
  href="api/org/slf4j/MarkingLogger.html">
  <code>org.slf4j.MarkingLogger</code></a>. This refactoring reduces
  the weight of the <a href="api/org/slf4j/Logger.html">
  <code>Logger</code></a> interface.
  </p>

  <h3>August 28th, 2005 - Release of SLF4J 1.0-beta7 and NLOG4J 1.2.17</h3>

  <p>Spurred by <a
  href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3">bug report
  #3</a>, SLF4J binding code has been refactored and
  simplified. Logging systems implementing SLF4J interfaces have to
  have less work in order to bind with SLF4J. Moreover, these changes
  have no incidence on the published interface of SLF4J.
  </p>

  
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>August 26th, 2005 - Release of SLF4J 1.0-beta6</h3>

  <p>To ease migration to SLF4J from JCL, this release includes a jar
  file called <em>jcl-over-slf4j-1.0.4.jar</em>. This jar file can be
  used as drop-in replacement for JCL version 1.0.4. It implements the
  public API of JCL using SLF4J underneath.
  </p>

  <p>Thus, you can immediately benefit from the advantages of SLF4J
  without waiting for all the libraries you depend on to migrate to
  SLF4J first.</p>
 
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>

  <h3>August 16th, 2005 - Release of NLOG4J 1.2.16</h3>

   <p>This release adds solves a compatibility problem between log4j
  and nlog4j.  Previous to this release, code compiled with log4j
  would not run correctly with nlog4j.
  </p>

  <p>With the fixes introduced in NLOG4J 1.2.16, code compiled with
  log4j 1.2.x will run without problems when deployed using NLOG4j.
  </p>

  <p>However, the inverse is not true. Code compiled with nlog4j can
  only be deployed using nlog4j.
  </p>
 
  <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"/>
  
  <h3>August 12th, 2005 - Release of SLF4J 1.0-beta5 and NLOG4J
  1.2.15</h3>

  <p>This release adds support for the <a
  href="api/org/slf4j/Marker.html">Marker</a> interface. Thus, log
  statements can be decorated with Marker data allowing more
  expressive power in the processing of log statements.
  </p>

  <p>For the sake of IoC frameworks, <code>Logger</code> instances can
  new be queried for their <a
  href="api/org/slf4j/Logger.html#getName()">name</a>.
  </p>

  <p>With the addition of markers, sub-domains are no longer
  needed.</p>

  <p>The <code>LoggerFactoryAdapter</code> has been simplified and
  renamed as <a
  href="api/org/slf4j/ILoggerFactory.html"><code>ILoggerFactory</code></a>.
  </p>

  <h3>July 5th, 2005 - Release of NLOG4J 1.2.14</h3>
 
  <p>This release fixes compatibility problems between NLOG4J and
  Jakarta Commons Logging.

  <h3>June 28th, 2005 - Release of SLF4J 1.0-beta4 and NLOG4J
  1.2.13</h3>

  <p>Following discussions on the SLF4J developers list, the
  signatures of the printing methods in <a
  href="api/org/slf4j/Logger.html"><code>org.slf4j.Logger</code></a>
  interface have been modified to admit messages of type
  <code>String</code> instead of type <code>Object</code> as
  previously. The current set of printing methods is listed below.
  </p>

  <pre class="source">
 void debug(String msg); 
 void debug(String format, Object arg); 
 void debug(String format, Object arg1, Object arg2); 
 void debug(String msg, Throwable t); 

 void error(String msg); 
 void error(String format, Object arg;)
