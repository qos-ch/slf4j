    <h1>SLF4J User manual</h1>
    
    <p>The Simple Logging Facade for Java or (SLF4J) is intended to
    serve as a simple facade for various logging APIs allowing to plug
    in the desired implementation at deployment time. 
    </p>
      
  <h2>Typical usage pattern</h2>
 
      <pre class="source">
 1: <b>import org.slf4j.Logger;</b>
 2: <b>import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;</b>
 3: 
 4: public class Wombat {
 5:  
 6:   <b>final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Wombat.class);</b>
 7:   Integer t;
 8:   Integer oldT;
 9:
10:   public void setTemperature(Integer temperature) {
11:    
12:     oldT = t;        
13:     t = temperature;
14:
15:     <b>logger.debug("Temperature set to {}. Old temperature was {}.", t, oldT);</b>
16:
17:     if(temperature.intValue() > 50) {
18:       <b>logger.info("Temperature has risen above 50 degrees.");</b>
19:     }
20:   }
21: }
      </pre>
      
      <p>The example above illustrates the typical usage pattern for
      SLF4j. Note the use of formatted log messages on line 15. See
      the question <a href="faq.html#2.3">"What is the fastest way of
      logging?"</a> in the FAQ for more details.
      </p>

      <h2>Swapping implementations at deployment time</h2>

        <p>SLF4J supports multiple logging systems, namely, NOP,
        Simple, log4j version 1.2, JDK 1.4 logging,
        JCL and logback. The SLF4J distribution ships with several jar
        files <em>slf4j-nop.jar</em>, <em>slf4j-simple.jar</em>,
        <em>slf4j-log4j12.jar</em>, <em>slf4j-log4j13.jar</em>,
        <em>slf4j-jdk14.jar</em> and <em>slf4j-jcl.jar</em>. Each of
        these jar files is hardwired <em>at compile-time</em> to use
        just one implementation, that is NOP, Simple, log4j version
        1.2, JDK 1.4 logging, and repectively
        JCL. <span style="color:#D22">As of SLF4J version  1.1.0, all of the
        bindings shipped with SLF4J depend on <em>slf4j-api.jar</em>
        which must be present on the class path for the binding to
        function properly.</span>        </p>

        <h2>Small applications</h2>

        <p>Small applications where configuring a fully-fledged
        logging systems can be somewhat of an overkill, can drop in
        <em> <em>slf4j-api.jar+</em>slf4j-simple.jar</em> instead of a binding for a
        fully-fledged logging system.        </p>

        <h2>Libraries</h2>

        <p>Authors of widely-distributed components and libraries may
        code against the SLF4J interface in order to avoid imposing an
        logging system on the end-user.  At deployment
        time, the end-user may choose the desired logging system by inserting the corresponding jar file in her
        classpath. This stupid, simple and robust approach avoids many
        of the painful bugs associated with dynamic discovery
        processes.
        </p>
     
        <h2>Simplicity</h2>

        <p>The SLF4J interfaces and their various adapters are
        extremely simple. Most developers familiar with the Java
        language should be able to read and fully understand the code
        in less than one hour. 
        </p>           

        <p>As noted earlier, SLF4J does not rely on any special class
        loader machinery. Every variant of
        <em>slf4j-&lt;impl&gt;.jar</em> is statically hardwired <em>at
        compile time</em> to use one and only specific
        implementation. Thus, SLF4J suffers from none of the <a
        href="http://www.qos.ch/logging/classloader.jsp">class loader
        problems observed when using JCL</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Hopefully, the simplicity of the SLF4J interfaces and the
        deployment model will make it easy for developers of other
        logging APIs to conform to the SLF4J model.
        </p>

        <h2>Built-in support in logback</h2>

        <p>The <code>ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger</code> class in logback directly
        implements SLF4J's <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface. Moreover,
        logback makes extensive use of SLF4J internally.
        </p>

        <p>Logback's built-in (a.k.a. native) support for SLF4J means
        that the adapter for does not need to wrap logback objects in
        order to make them conform to SLF4J's <code>Logger</code>
        interface. A logback
        <code>ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger</code> <em>is</em> a
        <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code>. Thus, using SLF4J in
        conjunction with logback involves strictly zero memory and
        computational overhead.

        <a name="gradual"><h2>Gradual migration to SLF4J from Jakarta
        Commons Logging (JCL)</h2></a>
        
        <h2><em>jcl104-over-slf4j.jar</em></h2>

        <p>To ease migration to SLF4J from JCL, recent SLF4J
        distributions include the jar file
        <em>jcl104-over-slf4j.jar</em>. This jar file is intended as a
        drop-in replacement for JCL version 1.0.4. It implements the
        public API of JCL but using SLF4J underneath, hence the name
        "JCL over SLF4J."
        </p>

        <p>Our JCL over SLF4J implementation will allow you to migrate
        to SLF4J gradually, especially if some of the libraries your
        software depends on continue to use JCL for the foreseeable
        future. You can immediately enjoy the benefits of SLF4J's
        reliability and preserve backward compatibility at the same
        time. Just replace <em>commons-logging.jar</em> with
        <em>jcl104-over-slf4j.jar</em>. Subsequently, the selection of
        the underlying logging system will be done by SLF4J instead of
        JCL but without the class loader headaches. The underlying
        logging system can be any of NOP, simple, jdk14 logging, log4j
        or logback. Any existing dependency on commons-logging
        therefore becomes less of an issue.
        </p>

        <h2><em>slf4j-jcl.jar</em></h2>

        <p>Some of our users after having switched to SLF4J API
        realize that in some contexts the use of JCL is mandatory and
        their use of SLF4J can be a problem. For this uncommon but
        important case, SLF4J offers a JCL binding, found in the file
        <em>slf4j-jcl.jar</em>. The JCL binding will delegate all
        logging calls made through SLF4J API to JCL. Thus, if for some
        reason an existing application <em>must</em> use JCL, your
        part of that application can still code against the SLF4J API
        in a manner transparent to the larger application
        environment. Your choice of SLF4J API will be invisible to the
        rest of the application which can continue to use JCL.
        </p>
          
        <h2><em>jcl104-over-slf4j.jar</em> should not be confused with
        <em>slf4j-jcl.jar</em></h2>
 
        
        <p>JCL-over-SLF4J, i.e. <em>jcl104-over-slf4j.jar</em>, comes
        in handy in situations where JCL needs to be supported for
        backward compatibility reasons. It can be used to fix problems
        associated with JCL, without necessarily adopting the SLF4J
        API, a decision which can be deferred to a later time.
        </p>
        
        <p>On the other hand, <em>slf4j-jcl.jar</em> is useful <strong>after</strong>        you have already adopted the SLF4J API for your component
        which needs to be embedded in a larger application environment
        where JCL is a formal requirement. Your software component can
        still use SLF4J API without disrupting the larger
        application. Indeed, <em>slf4j-jcl.jar</em> will delegate all
        logging decisions to JCL so that the dependency on SLF4J API
        by your component will be transparent to the larger whole.        </p>

        <p>Please note that <em>jcl104-over-slf4j.jar</em> and
        <em>slf4j-jcl.jar</em> cannot be deployed at the same
        time. The former jar file will cause JCL to delegate the
        choice of the logging system to SLF4J and the latter jar file
        will cause SLF4J to delegate the choice of the logging system
        to JCL, resulting in an infinite loop.
